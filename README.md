# Hey ðŸ‘‹!

My name is **Mazen Maliyakkal**. I am from Malappuram, Kerala, India. I have finished my Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science & Engineering** from **_N.S.S College of Engineering_** under **APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University** on July 2021.

I have started coding with C++ from 2015 after my High School studies. Lately, I have found myself using Javascript more, writing back-end in ExressJS and font-end in ReactJS for a few freelance projects using databases like Postgres and MongoDB. I have a few hobby projects in _GTK_ using _Rust_ and _Vala_.

Currently, I am working as a **Software Engineer** at **_Accubits Technologies Inc_**.
