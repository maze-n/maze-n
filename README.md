# Hey ðŸ‘‹!

I'm a full-stack engineer, who loves problem solving as well as building cool products, working in projects of various sectors, experienced in designing and building critical features, keeping in mind human experience, scalability, and maintainability.

My contribution in my organisation is mostly on designing, building and maintaining cloud infrastructure, backend APIs & services, improving code quality, as well as exploring and partaking in system design for various components / projects. 

Skilled in Javascript / Typescript (React / Express / NodeJS), Django REST Framework and SQL, with good experience in AWS and Azure Cloud Services. Engineering professional with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering degree from N. S. S College of Engineering, Palakkad, Kerala.

Profession aside, Iâ€™m a Linux (especially Desktop Linux) and Open Source enthusiast, I have a couple of hobby projects for GNOME Desktop and Elementary OS from my college days. My other experiences includes C++, Rust (With GTK for Linux Desktop Apps), Flutter (Android), as well as 3D modelling with Blender, which was during my student years.
